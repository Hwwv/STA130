# 09/13/24-09/16/24: Pre-HW and Post-HW
In this part, I learn about Coding, in data types, for loops, and logical control. Also, for using ChatBot,  I ask it for summaries of different dialogues in both Pre-HW and Post-HW. Links are given as well.

## Pre-HW
Here are 4 questions in total, while first three combing a part about Monte Hall Problem with the 4th alone with Markov Chain application.

LINKS: Dialogues with GPT
1. Q1-Q3: https://chatgpt.com/share/66e4266f-dab4-8008-81ad-928bf0ae32d1
2. Q4: https://chatgpt.com/share/66e4a515-db44-8010-8c17-7ded877657d5

*Summaries from ChatBot:*
1. Dialogue 1:

    Monte Hall Problem Explanation:

        We started with a detailed explanation of the Monty Hall problem, highlighting that it's a probability puzzle involving three doors. The key insight is that switching doors after Monty reveals a goat increases the chances of winning from 1/3 to 2/3.
    Code Walkthrough:

        You shared a Python simulation of the Monty Hall problem. I explained each part of the code step-by-step:
        How the winning door is randomly selected.
        ow Monty reveals a goat door.
        How the player switches to the remaining door.
        How the win counter is updated, and the final probability of winning by switching is calculated.

    Simplified Version of the Code:

        I provided a more streamlined and readable version of the simulation code, focusing on simplifying the logic:
        Using list comprehensions instead of removing elements from lists.
        Simplifying the door-switching logic for better clarity and avoiding unnecessary steps.

    Discussion on Readability and Efficiency:

        We discussed how simplifying code enhances readability by using clear variable names, logical flow, and minimal list manipulation.
        Although efficiency is less critical for this problem, we also made some minor improvements by avoiding list modifications and using direct list comprehensions.
        
    Final Summary:

        We concluded that the simplified version improves both readability and efficiency while maintaining clarity and correctness for simulating the Monty Hall problem.

2. Dialogue 2:

    In our dialogue, you shared a Markovian chatbot implementation, and I analyzed it for you. I explained how each part of the code works, including how it tracks word frequency and word transitions using dictionaries. I suggested improving the code by using defaultdict for simplicity and efficiency.

    I also provided ways to handle edge cases like punctuation and case sensitivity, and showed how to add randomness to the chatbot’s responses using random.choices. Additionally, I offered techniques to avoid conversational loops and make the chatbot interactive, where it responds based on user input.

    Finally, I summarized the key improvements:

        Using defaultdict

        Preprocessing text for better word handling

        Adding randomness

        Preventing repetitive loops

        Making the chatbot interactive


### Q1: Understanding of codes solving Monte Hall problem.

The following codes are from professor, which aims to show why choosing switch strategy is a better solution.

import numpy as np
all_door_options = (1,2,3)  # tuple
my_door_choice = 1  # 1,2,3
i_won = 0
reps = 100000
for i in range(reps):
    secret_winning_door = np.random.choice(all_door_options)
    all_door_options_list = list(all_door_options)
    # take the secret_winning_door, so we don't show it as a "goat" losing door
    all_door_options_list.remove(secret_winning_door)
    try:
        # if my_door_choice was secret_winning_door then it's already removed
        all_door_options_list.remove(my_door_choice)
    except:
        pass
    # show a "goat" losing door and remove it
    goat_door_reveal = np.random.choice(all_door_options_list)
    all_door_options_list.remove(goat_door_reveal)

    # put the secret_winning_door back in if it wasn't our choice
    # we previously removed it, so it would be shown as a  "goat" losing door
    if secret_winning_door != my_door_choice:
        all_door_options_list.append(secret_winning_door)
    # if secret_winning_door was our choice then all that's left in the list is a "goat" losing door
    # if secret_winning_door wasn't our choice then it's all that will be left in the list

    # swap strategy
    my_door_choice = all_door_options_list[0]

    if my_door_choice == secret_winning_door:
        i_won += 1

i_won/reps

Assisted with GPT, I read the codes and know that it saves the three doors within a tuple. Keeping one's selection as a default value. For experimental purposes, running the loop for many times, while keeping one's selecting car-behind door in record with beginnning 0. Then, in every time's experiment, use the np.random.choice\(\) to select the car-behind door. The next step is to show the goat door. That is, aside from car-behind door\(which may be the same with selected door\), pick one from the rest. So deleting the car-behind door from the list and adding back it if it is the selected one.\(using the try condition to see whether the are the same\). If I choose to switch and now i know one door is the wrong one with goat, I will not choose the goat door\(so delete it from the list\) and now i only have one door that i didn't select before in the list. It needs to add the door back if I didn't choose the car-behind door. Now my switch\(final decision\) will be seen in the list, indexing\[0\], so I take it. If it is the right door, count it in the record. At last, see how many times I win to see how the switch strategy is.

GPT explained the codes within 11 steps.

### Q2: Simplifying the code for readability and efficient.

I ask GPT to simplify the codes above with a simpler, more streamlined way for the loop.

It makes the reveal of Monte easier without adding or deleting not-car-doors by having a list of remaining doors. Then the switch using nesting conditions.

The reason why it is easier to read is that its structure follows the process of game, while constructing a simpler way to do the same action.

Codes-changed are as follows:

import numpy as np

# Number of simulations
reps = 100000
wins = 0  # Counter to track wins

for _ in range(reps):
    # Step 1: Randomly assign the winning door (1, 2, or 3)
    winning_door = np.random.choice([1, 2, 3])
    
    # Step 2: Player makes an initial choice (always choosing door 1 for simplicity)
    player_choice = 1
    
    # Step 3: Monty opens a door with a goat
    # Monty reveals a door that is not the player's choice and not the winning door
    remaining_doors = [door for door in [1, 2, 3] if door != player_choice and door != winning_door]
    monty_reveals = np.random.choice(remaining_doors)
    
    # Step 4: Player switches to the other remaining door
    switch_to = [door for door in [1, 2, 3] if door != player_choice and door != monty_reveals][0]
    
    # Step 5: Check if the switch leads to a win
    if switch_to == winning_door:
        wins += 1

# Calculate and print the win probability when switching
win_probability = wins / reps
print(f"Win probability when switching: {win_probability}")

### Q3: Explaining the codes-changed

As always, i'm looking for verifying the choice of swap strategy. This means in many independent experiments, if I get more chances to choose the car-behind door by swaping, then it is true. 

For making random experiment, import the package numpy for further useness.

I want to see my final winning times, so I start to count from 0.

suppose that i will do the experiment 100000 times.

now i begin the game, the for-loop,
 
suppose that Monte knows the car-door already at the beginning, using np.random.choice from the three-door list\[1,2,3\], save it for me-unknowing selection of goat-door.

get one door from the list as my original selection, player_choice, later be changed. take 1 for example.

then, Monte selects one goat-door\(not mine, not car-door\), which may be the only one remains if i select the other goat-door, or choosing from the two if i selected the car-door.

so keep the remain_doors with a list with inwards conditions of above, then let Monte selects one randomly from the remain_doors.

then i swap my choice by two != conditions from the doors list, which only contains one door.

check if it is car_door: if it is, add the count number, and calculate at last.

### Q4: Markovian ChatBot

I come to understand the function of every part in the codes.

defaultdict\(\) can avoid key error if key is not added yet

i need to count how many times a word appear after/before a word. so dictionary is used for storage. Besides, for the first-appearing word, it needs to be added into the dictionary.

from collections import defaultdict
word_used = dict() # defaultdict(int)
next_word = dict() # defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
for i,word in enumerate(words[:-1]):
    if word in word_used:
        word_used[word] += 1
    else:
        word_used[word] = 1
        next_word[word] = {}
    if words[i+1] in next_word[word]:
        next_word[word][words[i+1]] += 1
    else:
        next_word[word][words[i+1]] = 1

and GPT offers me an improved one:

def generate_sentence_with_memory(start_word, next_word, max_length=10):
    sentence = [start_word]
    current_word = start_word
    used_words = set([start_word])

    for _ in range(max_length - 1):
        if current_word in next_word:
            next_word_candidates = list(next_word[current_word].keys())
            next_word_weights = list(next_word[current_word].values())
            # Avoid words that have been used already
            filtered_candidates = [w for w in next_word_candidates if w not in used_words]

            if filtered_candidates:
                current_word = random.choice(filtered_candidates)
                used_words.add(current_word)
                sentence.append(current_word)
            else:
                break  # Stop if no new words can be used
        else:
            break

    return ' '.join(sentence)


## Post-HW: Q5-Q8
In this part, I communicate with ChatGPT on extensions of Markovian ChatBot, and test its understanding of extended functions.

Here are three links and summaries from GPT for Q5.1-Q5.3, Q8's dialogue:

Q5.1-5.2: https://chatgpt.com/share/66ea22cb-61f0-8010-b83e-3086ae151947

Q8: https://chatgpt.com/share/66ea3dc0-0b04-8010-8b48-619cc1caa2af
Q8's summary is in the later part.

**Q5.1-5.2: summary from GPT**

Initial Inquiry (Markov Chain Chatbot):

You started by sharing a code for a Markovian chatbot and asked for an explanation of how the code works. The code implemented word-based Markov chains using defaultdict for tracking word transitions.
Extensions to Markov Chains:

You then mentioned there are extended versions of the Markov chatbot code and asked for more insight into how those extensions work. We discussed different extensions and improvements that could be applied, such as making character-specific Markov chains and using bigrams (pairs of words) rather than single-word dependencies for more contextual responses.
Upgrading the Code:

We discussed how to modify the code to implement character-specific Markov chains and bigram-based word transitions to improve chatbot responses.
I provided a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the upgraded version of the code, including how it handles the bigram structure and how the character-specific chains function.

Complete Upgraded Code:

I shared the complete upgraded code, which includes functions to build Markov chains for different characters using bigrams and to generate responses using these chains. The code now allows for more coherent responses by using the context of the previous two words and is tailored for each character.
Summary of Functionality:

I explained each part of the upgraded code in detail, showing how the code builds and uses the Markov chains, how the bigram structure improves predictions, and how the responses are generated.

In summary, we discussed how to enhance a basic Markov chain chatbot to make it character-specific and more context-aware by using bigram-based transitions.

**Q5.3: summary from GPT**

In our conversation, you shared two versions of a Markovian ChatBot model: the original and an extended one. I explained how the extended version improves upon the original by introducing character-specific Markov chains, using bigrams (two-word combinations) for better context, and enabling response generation based on weighted random word selection. This allows the chatbot to generate more contextually accurate and varied responses, with distinct dialogue patterns for each character.

As I ask for extended version of Markovian ChatBot with requirements on making character specific Markov chains, and using bigrams (rather than just the previous word alone) dependency, GPT offers me with the codes as follow: 

from collections import defaultdict
import random

# Character-specific Markov chains
character_chains = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int)))

# Function to build a character-specific bigram Markov chain
def build_chain(character, words):
    for i in range(len(words) - 2):
        bigram = (words[i], words[i+1])  # Create bigram from two consecutive words
        next_word = words[i+2]  # The word following the bigram
        character_chains[character][bigram][next_word] += 1  # Increment the count of next_word for the bigram

# Example of building chains for multiple characters
character_dialogues = {
    'Alice': ['hello', 'world', 'hello', 'how', 'are', 'you'],
    'Bob': ['how', 'are', 'you', 'doing', 'today', 'hello', 'world'],
}

for character, words in character_dialogues.items():
    build_chain(character, words)

# Function to generate a response for a character using bigrams
def generate_response(character, start_words, length=10):
    response = list(start_words)  # Start the response with the provided bigram (start words)
    for _ in range(length - 2):  # Generate words up to the desired length
        bigram = (response[-2], response[-1])  # The current bigram is the last two words in the response
        possible_next_words = character_chains[character].get(bigram, None)  # Get next word options for the bigram

        if possible_next_words:
            # Select the next word based on frequency (weighted random choice)
            next_word = random.choices(list(possible_next_words.keys()), list(possible_next_words.values()))[0]
            response.append(next_word)  # Add the selected word to the response
        else:
            break  # If no valid next word is found, stop generating further
    return ' '.join(response)  # Return the generated response as a string

# Example usage: generating responses for Alice and Bob
start_words_alice = ('hello', 'world')
response_alice = generate_response('Alice', start_words_alice)
print("Alice's response:", response_alice)

start_words_bob = ('how', 'are')
response_bob = generate_response('Bob', start_words_bob)
print("Bob's response:", response_bob)


Later, I start a new session of GPT and asks for the functioning of each part in the extended version. It seems that it understands the codes with the notation and annotaions.

*It says:*

The extended version of the Markovian ChatBot introduces several improvements and added features compared to the original. Here's an explanation of the key differences:

Character-specific Markov Chains:

The extended version creates separate Markov chains for different "characters." This means each character has their own word transition model based on their specific dialogue data.
The dictionary character_chains is a three-level nested dictionary:
First level: the character (e.g., 'Alice', 'Bob').
Second level: a bigram (pair of consecutive words).
Third level: the frequency count of words that follow the bigram.

Bigrams:

In the original version, the model looks at single words and their following word to build the transition model.
The extended version uses bigrams, which are pairs of consecutive words, to predict the next word. This improves the context sensitivity, as the model now takes two previous words into account instead of one, allowing for more coherent responses.
Random Response Generation:

In the original model, it simply builds a transition map between words. The extended version adds a generate_response function, which creates a response for a given character starting from two initial words.
The response generation uses a weighted random choice (random.choices) based on the frequency of words that follow a bigram, making the generated text more probabilistic and varied.
Example Dialogue Chains:

The extended model allows you to build chains for multiple characters, using a dialogue dataset (character_dialogues). Each character’s dialogue is processed separately, allowing the chatbot to generate responses that reflect the speech patterns of specific characters.
In summary, the extended version enhances the original by:

Introducing character-specific chains.
Using bigrams for better context in word prediction.
Adding the ability to generate probabilistic responses.

### Q6: Report
1. Yes, it is helpful in all kinds of ways, both technical details and thinking and conclusion ways. For example, when I ask it about Monte Hall problems, it will naturally give me a structural explanation of the original problem, while giving response towards the codes and give further details and even better solutions. However, asking for direct links tends to be not so easy.
2. I think it is not so frastrating when there is a clue offered by ourselves. Because sometimes, GPT is better at tackling details rather than the whole picture of the dialogue. And I need to check the situation and whether its talking solid or not.
3. generally speaking, it is helpful in the following ways:
    1. exact definitions of codes: like function, attribute, method
    2. necessary comparisions and differences between objects: like observations and varibles
    3. simple and featured examples of different situlations: simple cases in datasets' description
    4. quick and in time: always here for help.

### Q7: Reflection
I guess 60% of my understanding of codes, especially the details of techniques is from GPT. While learning statistics, I rely on the textbook more. For data science, I would say that half from course materials and half from GPT.

### Q8: Search consensensus
