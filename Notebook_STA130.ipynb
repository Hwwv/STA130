    "        We started with a detailed explanation of the Monty Hall problem, highlighting that it's a probability puzzle involving three doors. The key insight is that switching doors after Monty reveals a goat increases the chances of winning from 1/3 to 2/3.\n",
    "    Code Walkthrough:\n",

    "        How the player switches to the remaining door.\n",

    "    Simplified Version of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "        I provided a more streamlined and readable version of the simulation code, focusing on simplifying the logic:\n",
    "        Using list comprehensions instead of removing elements from lists.\n",
    "        Simplifying the door-switching logic for better clarity and avoiding unnecessary steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Discussion on Readability and Efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "        We discussed how simplifying code enhances readability by using clear variable names, logical flow, and minimal list manipulation.\n",
    "        Although efficiency is less critical for this problem, we also made some minor improvements by avoiding list modifications and using direct list comprehensions.\n",
